Information about delegates to a conference are taken and noun phrases are obtained from their bios. These noun phrases are collected into a list and then edited to have only nouns that represent individuals' interests. The list of interests are further edited in python so that only interests shared by two or ore delegates exist. This information is converted into a node-edge graph reprensentation which is then put into a Google Fusion Table, which draws the connection between delegates in the conference based on interest. The hope is that this tool will help delegates get to know each other better.
